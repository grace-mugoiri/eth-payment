- the simple initPayButton allows one to send ethereum to another account using web3.
- When a user clicks the pay button, it checks to see if there is a metamask account present, if so it will ask for the approval and when you accept it will send 1 ether to the said account.
- currentProvider checks to see of metamask is available.
